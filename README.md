✨ Innovation In addition to meeting the core requirements, the following enhancements were implemented to improve functionality, usability, and user experience:

🔁 Password Reset Feature: A fully functional "Forgot Password?" modal using Firebase Auth, allowing users to reset their credentials — even though this was not part of the original specification.

🔙 Back Navigation on Login Page: A back button was added to the login screen, allowing users to easily return to the homepage — improving navigability and user control.

🎮 "Play Again" Logic: After completing the game, users are given the option to play again, resetting the game state and allowing for repeat engagement without needing to refresh the page.

These features demonstrate thoughtful attention to user experience and flow, going beyond what's expected to make the app more complete and user-friendly.

Assumptions and Decisions Icon Library Choice: I used the lucide-react icon set for consistency and simplicity across the app, even if the original design specified different icons. This was a deliberate choice to maintain a uniform look and ease development.

Background in Image Carousel: The background in the image carousel page was adjusted from the original Figma design because the images did not fit well with the plain background. To enhance visual appeal and maintain design balance, I added subtle blinking stars as a background effect, creating a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
